This repository contains architecture figures used in the DeepPAITI manuscript, illustrating the main model and commonly used comparison models for extracting secondary PAITI maps.

Models included:

DeepPAITI (main model)

Encoder-Decoder

ResNet

UNet

VGG-16

Dense (Fully Connected)

After publication of the manuscript, code implementations of these models will be added to this repository.
